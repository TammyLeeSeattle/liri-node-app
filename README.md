## UW Bootcamp Week 10 Homework

Welcome to the baby sister of Apple's SIRI... LIRI!

## The assignment
In this assignment, you will make LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

## How to access it
Because this is a command-line application, there's no "front-end" to show you, but if you'd like to clone the repo, here it is!: [https://github.com/TammyLeeSeattle/liri-node-app.git](https://github.com/TammyLeeSeattle/liri-node-app.git)
